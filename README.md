# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle)

This project uses a deep learning approach with Keras and hyperparameter tuning via KerasTuner to predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa. The dataset is provided by the [Kaggle House Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Features
- Preprocessing with missing value handling and label encoding
- Standardization with `StandardScaler`
- Customizable deep neural network using Keras
- Hyperparameter tuning with KerasTuner (`RandomSearch`)
- Log-transformed target for stable training
- Submission-ready CSV file output
